# Open-Source List
We list all the datasets, models, training and testing codes related to SeqXGPT here.
# Datasets
We use the SeqXGPT dataset and expand its content to include more advanced LLMs, such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4o. The SeqXGPT dataset is a sentence-level dataset specifically designed for detecting AI-generated text and includes text generated by various LLMs. These LLMs include GPT-2, GPT-J, GPT-Neo, LLaMa, Qwen, and other open-source models.

{"text": "high - salt has been shown to play a role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disease . in this study , we investigated the effect of high - salt on the production of inflammatory mediators by arpe-19 cells and the possible mechanisms involved . arpe-19 cells were cultured with lps in dmem to which extra nacl had been added ( 20  mm and 40  mm ) .  High salt intake has been linked to the development of autoimmune diseases. In our study, we explored how high salt levels affect the production of inflammatory mediators in ARPE-19 cells and delved into the possible underlying mechanisms. We cultured ARPE-19 cells with LPS in DMEM, adding extra NaCl at concentrations of 20 mM and 40 mM.\n\nThe cells were incubated for 24 hours, after which we collected the supernatants and used ELISA to detect inflammatory cytokines. We also performed an MTT assay to check cell viability, ensuring that any observed effects weren't due to cytotoxicity.\n\nOur findings indicated that higher salt conditions significantly boosted the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines like IL-6 and TNF-\u03b1 in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, we noticed an upregulation in the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway, suggesting it may play a role in the inflammatory response triggered by high salt.\n\nTo understand the mechanisms further, we conducted a Western blot analysis to observe the expression levels of key proteins in the NF-\u03baB pathway. We discovered that high salt conditions caused increased phosphorylation of I\u03baB\u03b1, indicating activation of NF-\u03baB.\n\nIn conclusion, our study suggests that high salt levels can heighten inflammatory responses in ARPE-19 cells through the activation of the NF-\u03baB signaling pathway. These insights shed light on how a high salt diet might contribute to the development of autoimmune diseases.",

**text** refers to an entire document.  
**prompt_len** marks the boundary between the sentences generated by humans and those generated by AI. The first prompt_len characters of the input text, i.e., text[:prompt_len], are the sentences generated by humans, while the rest are generated by a particular language model.  
**label** is the label for each sentence, and there are eight types of labels in total:gpt2,gpt3.5 gpt3.5A,gpt4o gpt4A,qwen2,llama,human.
